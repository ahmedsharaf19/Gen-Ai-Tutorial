    "**Faiss (Facebook AI Similarity Search)** هي مكتبة مفتوحة المصدر طورتها شركة Facebook AI، وتُستخدم لإجراء البحث الكفء عن التشابه (Similarity Search) والتجميع (Clustering) بين المتجهات الكثيفة (Dense Vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ ما هي Faiss؟\n",
    "- مكتبة متخصصة في البحث السريع عن المتجهات المتشابهة داخل مجموعات ضخمة من البيانات.\n",
    "- تدعم البحث حتى مع مجموعات بيانات لا يمكن تحميلها بالكامل في الذاكرة (RAM).\n",
    "- مصممة للتعامل مع بيانات عالية الأبعاد (High-dimensional vectors).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ الاستخدامات:\n",
    "- البحث الدلالي (Semantic Search).\n",
    "- استرجاع المعلومات (Information Retrieval).\n",
    "- محركات التوصية (Recommendation Systems).\n",
    "- تطبيقات البحث عن الصور والفيديوهات المشابهة.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ المزايا:\n",
    "- كفاءة عالية جدًا في الأداء حتى مع بيانات ضخمة.\n",
    "- توفر خوارزميات بحث متنوعة (Flat, IVFFlat, HNSW, وغيرها).\n",
    "- دعم للمعالجة على الـ CPU و GPU.\n",
    "- أدوات مساعدة للتقييم وضبط المعاملات (Parameter Tuning).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ مثال مبسط:\n",
    "- عند تحويل النصوص إلى متجهات (Embeddings)، يمكن استخدام Faiss للبحث عن أقرب المتجهات (Nearest Neighbors).\n",
    "- تستخدم كثيرًا مع نماذج التضمين مثل OpenAI Embeddings أو HuggingFace models.\n",
